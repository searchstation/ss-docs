### Introduction
This document outlines some best practices for common situations that can bring down SEO rankings in websites.

### Multiple H1 tags
Multiple H1 tags bring down SEO ranking, this should be avoided. It can be identified and resolved in the following steps;
1. Right click on any space on the webpage. From the menu, select "View Page Source".
2. On the page source, using "Ctrl (or command) + F", search for "h1".
3. The texts that have the "h1" tag is then visible to be taken care of.
4. If the texts can only be edited from the codebase, contact the developer to resolve.

### Folder Structure
All images should be saved in a single folder (no sub-folders). This makes it easy to spot missing images and also means the import process can look at a single directory for all image files.
