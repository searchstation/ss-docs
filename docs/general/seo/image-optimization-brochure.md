### Introduction
This document outlines an optimised image naming convention for brochure sites. This convention allows images to be bulk imported and exported from the site.

### Image Specification
- File type: JPG
- Optimum size: 1200px by 1200px
- Target file size: 80~150kb (we can compress on upload)
- Image variations (where applicable, each image should be named appropriately, bearing the variations in mind):
    - Images on different backgrounds,
    - Images with brand logos,
    - Images with the key specs (size/features),
    - The image being used in-situ,etc.

### Image Naming
Images should be named based on the content of the image. In the case of multiple words, which is very common, each word should be separated with hyphens.

<img src="https://searchstation.github.io/ss-docs/assets/images/seo-images/office-meeting-space.jpg" alt="Office Meeting Space">

For example, the image above should take the naming format - `office-meeting-space.jpg`.

### Folder Structure
All images should be saved in a single folder (no sub-folders). This makes it easy to spot missing images and also means the import process can look at a single directory for all image files.
