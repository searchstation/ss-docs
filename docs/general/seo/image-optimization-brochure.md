### Introduction
This document outlines an optimised image naming convention for brochure sites. This convention allows images to be bulk imported and exported from the site.

### Image Specification
- File type: JPG
- Optimum size: 1200px by 1200px
- Target file size: 80~150kb (we can compress on upload)
- Image variations (where applicable, each product should have as many of these variations as possible):
    - Product on what background (Google Shopping)
    - Product with brand logos
    - Product with the key spec (size/features)
    - The product being used in-situ

### Image Naming
Images should be named based on the content of the image. In the case of multiple words, which is very common, each word should be separated with hyphens. For example, the image below;

<img src="../../../assets/images/seo-images/office-meeting-space.png" alt="Office Meeting Space">

assets/images/seo-images/office-meeting-space.png

The image above should take the naming format - `office-meeting-space.jpg`.

### Folder Structure
All images should be saved in a single folder (no sub-folders). This makes it easy to spot missing images and also means the import process can look at a single directory for all image files.
