### Overview
Discontinued products should be used to inform customers a product is no longer available to purchase while linking to suitable replacements.

### How to discontinue a product
There are only two required steps to discontinue a product:
1. In the Product Data section of the product, change the Product Type to “Discontinued”
2. Change the “Menu Order” value to a higher value to demote the product within the catalogue. For example, if the product has a Menu Order of 20, changing it to 2000 would ensure it appears at the end of the product catalogue list.

### Dynamic metadata for discontinued products
A number of rules have been set up to remove certain metadata and functions for a discontinued product. This data can remain in place on the product page. This includes:

1. Removal of price
2. Removal of adding to basket button
3. Removal of “ask a question” form
4. Removal of additional product images
5. Removal of delivery information
6. Removal of the ability to add new reviews (existing product reviews will remain)
7. Removal of key benefits meta on the product card
8. Additional of “Discontinued” label below the product title
9. Addition of “Discontinued” sash on the product thumbnail (product card)

### Considerations
- Images should remain as they are (no sash added to the actual image)
- Products should remain in their existing category
- Product attributes should remain connected to the product
- Price and stock data should remain unchanged
